Tashi aims to be a versatile, easy to set up cluster management system,
allowing the use, sharing and manipulation of cluster resources
in a convenient, efficient, and safe manner.

Tashi was originally just the virtual machine manager, and Zoni
was the hardware manager, but both are now in Tashi together.
